        Want to Join Cthulhu's Army and Smite Some Non-Believers? Here's How!
      </div>
      <b class="text-xl">Step One: Go Insane</b>
      <div class="text-md">
        The first step in joining Cthulhu’s army is to go insane. This can be accomplished through a variety of methods,
        such as prescribed medications or sleep deprivation. It is important to understand that in order to properly
        join Cthulhu’s army, you must willingly relinquish all notions of sanity. Your mental state will determine
        whether or not you are accepted into the ranks of Cthulhu’s followers. Medication is one way to quickly and
        effectively relinquish sanity and join the forces of Cthulhu. When taken correctly and under the supervision of
        a doctor, medication can help to dull the senses and reduce cognitive functioning, making it easier to accept
        the dark call of Cthulhu. Sleep deprivation is also an effective method of attaining a mentally unstable state,
        but it is important to note that it should only be done in short bursts and with care, as overdoing it can be
        detrimental to one’s health. Remember, going insane is the first step to joining Cthulhu’s army. Be sure to
        carefully consider your decision before embarking on this journey, and make sure you have the support of friends
        and family to help you stay on the right path. Good luck!
      </div>
      <b class="text-xl">Step Two: Sell Your Soul</b>
      <div class="text-md">
        The second step to joining Cthulhu’s Army is a relatively easy one, but it is also the most important one.
        Selling your soul is the single most important act of obedience you can do for Cthulhu, and will give you access
        to all the benefits that come with being a member of his army. Selling your soul to Cthulhu doesn’t require any
        particular type of religious ceremony or initiation process, nor does it require a specific set of words or
        actions. All that is required is for you to truly and sincerely give yourself over to Cthulhu’s will and accept
        him as your master. This act alone will be enough to signify that you have given up your own free will and that
        you are now devoted to serving Cthulhu’s every desire. Doing this requires a level of commitment and dedication
        that some might consider risky, but that is exactly what it takes to be part of Cthulhu’s Army. By selling your
        soul, you are showing your unwavering loyalty to the Lord of R’lyeh and the dark forces he commands. In
        exchange, you will be granted access to untold power and knowledge. So if you’re ready to take a leap of faith
        and join Cthulhu’s Army, you must be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice: your own soul. Only then will you
        be able to reap the rewards of being a true servant of the Great Old One.
      </div>
      <b class="text-xl">Step Three: Move to R'lyeh</b>
      <div class="text-md">
        Moving to R'lyeh is essential if you want to join Cthulhu's army and fight hordes of non believers. You can't do
        this unless you abandon your physical form through some means, preferably one that provides a large spectacle.
        One way to go about this is to use dark sorcery or find a demon or an ancient god who will agree to transport
        you there. They may ask for something in return, but be warned—once you have made a pact with them, there is no
        going back. Alternatively, you could attempt to open a portal between our world and the world of R'lyeh. This is
        incredibly risky and should only be attempted by experienced magicians. Once the portal is opened, you will need
        to take the plunge and enter the realm of Cthulhu. Whichever method you choose, it will not be easy and it will
        require a great deal of courage and strength. But once you've made it to R'lyeh, you will be able to join
        Cthulhu's army and begin your fight against non believers. Good luck!
      </div>
      <b class="text-xl">Step Four: Await Orders</b>
      <div class="text-md">
        After completing the previous steps, you will now wait in the dark embrace of Cthulhu. You are now part of his
        army and will receive orders on how to smite his enemies. As a new member of the cult of Cthulhu, you must have
        faith in his judgment and have the courage to follow his instructions. You may find yourself receiving
        instructions from strange sources such as dreams or visions that you receive. Be sure to take all of the
        instructions given seriously and act quickly when prompted. When you have received the order, use your new form
        and powers to smite those who do not believe. The rewards for following Cthulhu’s orders are great, but so too
        are the risks. Be sure to use caution when acting out his orders and always be mindful of the consequences of
        your actions. As long as you remain loyal and true to Cthulhu, he will reward you with eternal life in his
        kingdom. Good luck!
